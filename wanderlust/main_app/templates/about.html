<h1>About the Wanderlust</h1>
<p>In the world of modern travel, 
    the process of planning trips has become disjointed and inefficient. 
    Travelers find themselves frustrated with the lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that allows them to organize their journeys,

       seamlessly add destinations, and facilitate group travel coordination, all while fostering a sense of shared adventure. By addressing these pain points,
